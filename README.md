# hrmanager
An application which lets you manage your employees (in the future maybe I will add pay out methods).

# Requirements
## backend:
Python, django, django-cors-headers, django-rest-framework, python-dotenv
## frontend:
node, axios, reactstrap, bootstrap, react, react-dom

# How to run
In backend folder write npm run start
In frontend folder write python manage.py runserver
(will add docker so it will be easier to start app)
